# Voron 2.4 Umbilical mount for PG11 threads (CNLinko LP-16)

Umbilical mount for PG-11 thread. I sourced LP-16 connectors from CNLinko and couldn't find a mount for the PG-11 thread they use so I designed them. 
Thanks to

and hartk (https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%202-Trident/2.4/CW2_SB2040_CAN_Umbilical) 

for the sources and inspiration <3

The A-Drive mount is 2-parts, designed it for 2 5x3x4mm heat-set inserts (Voron standard) and 2x M3x20 SHCS. They are very close to the outer shell,
so set the inserrts with the lowest possible temperature or go fast to not melt everything.

PG11_Umb_A_Mount_Teil1.stl has some error in the threads but it works perfect.
